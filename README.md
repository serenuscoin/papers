# The white paper for Serenus Coin

A TLDR:

The standard three types of stablecoins treat the central problem they are trying to solve -- volatility -- in different ways.

1. Submerge crytocurrency volatility in the relative stability of the US dollar
2. Trade volatility in the present for volatility in the future
3. Underleverage cryptocurrency volatility to make it more stable

Serenus Coin takes a new, fourth, approach. One that is more
transparent about where the volatility goes when creating a
stablecoin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**4. Transfer volatility to a willing holder of the collateral**

Each new serenus token that is issued by the Serenus Coin system implies a long position on the part of issuers who have deposited ether with an issuer contract. The issuers are paid a commission on each trade as an incentive to respond to changes in the demand for holding serenus. In addition the price of the trade is adjusted to reflect the liquidity constraints faced in hedging the amount of ether sent into the system by users on each trade.
